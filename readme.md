<h1>Neumont Group Network</h1>
<h3>What is this?</h3>
<p>I like to call this project the "Neumont Group Network". Through this site, current students of Neumont University will be able to create a webpage for their clubs and orders in order to better maintain online presence.</p>
<h3>What technologies am I using?</h3>
<p>This website is built with Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL.</p>
<h3>Why are you doing this?</h3>
<p>I am working on this project because I see a need in my school's community for a centralized website where students can easily keep up to date on a group's activities and other members.</p>
